_Background: This scanner is called the 200 Scanner because it checks for the [server response code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) from a specific URL.  The 200 server response means `OK` or that the file or page exists at that location and loads successfully.  Other commmon codes include 301 - `Moved Permanently`, 302 - `Found (moved temporarily)`,  403 - `Forbidden`, 404 - `Not Found`, and 500 - `Server Error`.  2xx codes refer to successful page loads; 3xx codes refer to redirects; 4xx codes refer to client errors, and 5xx codes refer to server errors._
