# Privacy Page Scan

## Summary

The privacy scans checks for the presence of a Privacy Policies page at x.gov/privacy and analyzes it for several characteristics, namely: 

* Email addresses listed in the page
* Major page sections (as indicated by header tags)

#### Relevant Policy

* "The agency’s Privacy Program Page must be located at www.[agency].gov/privacy and must be accessible through the agency’s “About” page." - _[OMB M-17-06](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf)_
* "At the discretion of the SAOP, sub-agencies, components, and programs may maintain a sub-agency-, component-, or program-specific privacy program page. If an agency subagency, component, or program uses a domain that is different from the agency’s domain, the sub-agency-, component-, or program-specific privacy program page must be accessible through www.[sub-agency, component, or program domain].gov/privacy. " - _[OMB M-17-06](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/memoranda/2017/m-17-06.pdf)_
* Other guidance that requires certain content on privacy policy pages (there are many)
