# U.S. Web Design System Scanner

## Summary
The [USWDS scanner](https://site-scanning.app.cloud.gov/searchUSWDS/) checks each domain for the use of [U.S. Web Design System (USWDS)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) code and the code version.

Specifically, the scan [searches for](https://github.com/18F/domain-scan/blob/tspencer/200scanner/scanners/uswds2.py#L36-L123): 

* Presence of `-usa` class in CSS
* `uswds` in HTML
* `.usa-` in HTML
* `favicon-57.png` (the USWDS favicon) in HTML and CSS
* Fonts used by USWDS (`Public Sans`, `Source Sans`, and `Merriweather`)
* `uswds` or `uswds version` in CSS

The scanner also searches for the presence of HTML tables, and uses them as a counter indicator.

## Details

USWDS is toolkit of design principles, user experience guidance, and code. Agencies can—and should—adopt USWDS incrementally. Use of USWDS is not binary so we can't definitively say whether a site does or does not use USWDS. 

The scanner uses the presence of various elements as indicators that a site is using USWDS code. It returns an analysis count, not a score or yes/no. The highest counts are around 150, and the floor is set at 0. The mode is 0. Each element is weighted differently. For example, `Source Sans` or `Merriweather` are weighted less than `Public Sans` because they are more common.

The `-usa` CSS classes can appear as few as 10 times or as many as 100+, so the scanner tallies them and records the count  based on its square root (e.g. 36 becomes 6, 64 becomes 8). The scanner then multiples the count by 5 to increase its weight. 

The presence of `<table>` in the home page HTML _reduces_ the counts. Every HTML table found on the home page receives -10 points.
