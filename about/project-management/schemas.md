For certain, hand-maintained data fields, Site Scanning relies on a particular, publicly-accessible data file.  

## Website Category and Type

This data file serves to populate the `website-category` and `website-type` fields.  

Category is used to classify individual Target URLs in different ways so that the set that represents an agency's web presence can be clearly identified.  


Category Fields: 

* website - Considered one of an agency's public websites (e.g. 18f.gsa.gov)  
* redirect - Redirects to a website (e.g. www.18f.gov)  
* api - Serves as the domain for an API endpoint (e.g. api.gsa.gov)  
* staging - A staging or development website (e.g. staging.code.gov)  
* non-public - A website that is not available to the public (e.g. login.fr.cloud.gov)  
* not-a-website - A catch-all for any other reason to not consider this target URL a public website  


Type is used to differentiate the major groups of public websites that the federal government operates.

Type Fields:  
* agency - The primary website of an agency (e.g. www.fda.gov)  
* component - The primary website of an agency subcomponent (e.g. oig.hhs.gov)  
* organization - The website for an organization that is not an agency or subcomponent (e.g. www.acwi.gov)  
* system - The website for an agency system (e.g. www.sam.gov)  
* campaign - The website for a government campaign (e.g. www.feedthefuture.gov)
