## Ideas for the program that we should consider for the future

* [Store historical data](https://github.com/18F/site-scanning/issues/377)  
* [Create a site scanning community of practice with OGP, NIST, CISA, etc., open to anyone](https://github.com/18F/site-scanning/issues/606)  
* [Create a section of the web presence or some other hub (like a repo) just for analysis of scan results](https://github.com/18F/site-scanning/issues/609)  
* [Enable diffs of scan data](https://github.com/18F/site-scanning/issues/625)  
* [Enable diffs of scanned files](https://github.com/18F/site-scanning/issues/626)  
* Use google sheets to create a summary page that does a bunch of analysis (how many website per agency, etc) and then publish that regularly into github.  
* What else?
