An important principle of the Site Scanning project is to identify specific programs and people within TTS, GSA, and the wider government that our scans can deliver real value to.  Asking these users what data would be useful to them and how we can iterate these scans and report pages is key to this program's success.  

## Active Stakeholder Relationships

Here's the programs that are currently identified as active stakeholders that are using our scans and from whom we are soliciting feedback on each iteration.  

#### Data.gov

...

#### The Digital Analytics Program 

* We've built report pages and direct download links for DAP implementation data that the program needs.  
* We've performed a [quality assessment](https://github.com/18F/site-scanning-documentation/blob/master/scans/qa_analysis/dap-scan-6-20.md) of the DAP scan data. 
* Next, we intend to:
  * Propose a report page at analytics.usa.gov/participation that shows current progress in implementing DAP (along the lines that pulse.cio.gov used to provide).  
  * Use the results of the [quality assessment](https://github.com/18F/site-scanning-documentation/blob/master/scans/qa_analysis/dap-scan-6-20.md) to further refine the scan methodology.  

#### Search.gov 

...

#### USWDS Team 

...

#### TTS Digital Council

* We've built report pages and direct download links for DAP implementation data that the group needs to track agency progress.  
* Next, we intend to:
  * Make a simple, replicatable report page that an agency can use to return DAP status for a set list of agency subdomains (i.e. their hand-curated list of 'actual websites' that leaves off staging environments, etc.) 
  
#### DigitalDashboard.gov

#### GSA Digital Council 

* We've built report pages and direct download links for DAP implementation data that the group needs to track agency progress.  
* Next, we intend to:
  * Make a simple, replicatable report page that an agency can use to return DAP status for a set list of agency subdomains (i.e. their hand-curated list of 'actual websites' that leaves off staging environments, etc.)

## Initiated Stakeholder Relationships

These programs have been identified as possible stakeholders and we have solicited feedback and created at least one MVP product for them.  We need to check back in with the team to re-evaluate what would be useful to them.  

#### Code.gov team

#### api.data.gov team

#### Feedback Analytics team

#### GSA Chief Privacy Officer
