An important principle of the Site Scanning project is to identify specific programs and people within TTS, GSA, and the wider government that our scans can deliver real value to.  Asking these users what data would be useful to them and how we can iterate these scans and report pages is key to this program's success.  

## Active Stakeholder Relationships

Here's the programs that are currently identified as active stakeholders that are using our scans and from whom we are soliciting feedback on each iteration.   

#### The Digital Analytics Program 

* We've built report pages and direct download links for DAP implementation data that the program needs.  
* We've performed a [quality assessment](/scans/qa_analysis/dap-scan-6-20.md) of the DAP scan data. 
* Next, we intend to:
  * Propose a report page at analytics.usa.gov/participation that shows current progress in implementing DAP (along the lines that pulse.cio.gov used to provide).  
  * Use the results of the [quality assessment](/scans/qa_analysis/dap-scan-6-20.md) to further refine the scan methodology.  

#### Search.gov 

* We've built report pages and direct download links for search related data that the program needs.  
* We've solicited feedback from the search.gov team and identified from them what data they most need from us that they don't yet have.  
* Next, we intend to:
  * Use the results of the feedback session to expand what is scanned.  
  * Perform a quality assessment to further refine the scan methodology.  


#### USWDS Team 

* We've built report pages and direct download links for USWDS implementation data that the program needs.  
* We've performed a [quality assessment](https://github.com/18F/site-scanning-documentation/blob/main/scans/qa_analysis/uswds-scan-7-20.md) of the USWDS scan data. 
* Next, we intend to:
  * Use the results of the quality assessment (link needed) to further refine the scan methodology.  


#### TTS Digital Council

* We've built report pages and direct download links for DAP implementation data that the group needs to track agency progress.  
* Next, we intend to:
  * Make a simple, replicatable report page that an agency can use to return DAP status for a set list of agency subdomains (i.e. their hand-curated list of 'actual websites' that leaves off staging environments, etc.) 
  
#### DigitalDashboard.gov

* We've solicited feedback from the digitaldashboarde.gov team and identified from them what data they most need from us that they don't yet have.  
* First, we intend to:
  * Restart fresh subdomain list generation.  

#### GSA Digital Council 

* We've built report pages and direct download links for DAP implementation data that the group needs to track agency progress.  
* Next, we intend to:
  * Make a simple, replicatable report page that an agency can use to return DAP status for a set list of agency subdomains (i.e. their hand-curated list of 'actual websites' that leaves off staging environments, etc.)

## Initiated Stakeholder Relationships

These programs have been identified as possible stakeholders and we have solicited feedback and created at least one MVP product for them.  We need to check back in with the team to re-evaluate what would be useful to them.  


#### Data.gov

* We've built report pages and direct download links for data hub, developer hub, and data.json data.  
* Next, the data.gov team is considering if and how the site scanning program can be useful for powering a new version of [this dashboard](https://labs.data.gov/dashboard/).  
  * We also need to do a quality assessment of the current scan data. 

#### Code.gov team

#### api.data.gov team

#### Feedback Analytics team

#### GSA Chief Privacy Officer
