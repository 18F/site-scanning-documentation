## Process for Onboarding Potential Stakeholders

In order to try and keep the work of the Site Scanning program grounded, we've evolved a process for how new scans are added and future work is prioritized.  The goal is to make sure that the program is generating data that real stakeholders actually need.  With a [long list](https://github.com/18F/site-scanning-documentation/blob/main/pages/candidate-scans.md) of _ideas_ for further scans, we hope that the below process keeps us focused and ensures that we are good stewards of our stakeholders' time. 

#### A) Hypothesis

Someone suggests how a new scan field could be useful to a potential stakeholder.  We keep a [list of every idea](https://github.com/18F/site-scanning-documentation/blob/main/pages/candidate-scans.md) that we get, as well as any notes on who might need that data.  

#### B) Research 

The most important initial questions we ask are:
* Exactly what is being scanned for
* Who is the specific stakeholder that might want to use this
* How useful might the stakeholder find this (and how often)
* What are some methods for scanning this and how hard or easy do we think it would be

If we identify a likely stakeholder that there's some reason to think would gain real value from the new data fields and if the possible value may warrant the anticipated effort and difficulty of creating the new scan, then we'll look to proceed to the next step.
