## Overview

This project is in the alpha stage.  Version 1.0 will be what we are comfortable sharing widely with other agencies and will mark the transition of the project to the beta stage (where it will likely stay indefinitely).  

## Version History

### v 0.3 

* Added individual pages for each 200 scanner 
* Added a /developer page 
* Added an /about page
* Added JSON and CSV export options 


### v 0.2

* Created a combined website that brought together the different scan results pages and created a combined home.
* Created the 200 scanner search page
* Created the USWDS scanner search page 


### v 0.1

* The initial rough MVP that we threw together to get started.

### Prototypes

- [**200 scanner**](https://site-scanning.app.cloud.gov/search200/) - Checks domains for the presence or absence of a file at a specific location, specifically by analyzing the server response code at that location, such as x.gov/code.json, x.gov/data.jason, x.gov/data, x.gov/developer, x.gov/digitalstrategy, x.gov/open, x.gov/privacy, x.gov/robots.txt, x.gov/sitemap.xml
- [**U.S. Web Design System**](https://site-scanning.app.cloud.gov/searchUSWDS/) - Checks domains for the presence or absence of U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) components and USWDS version in use.



## Milestones

| Rank          | Priority      | Goal          | Measure       |
| ------------- | ------------- |-------------  | ------------- |
| 1 | 1  | Data prototype returns data stakeholder(s) find useful and can take action on  | 1. Data - Discover data to incorporate on data.gov; show agency compliance with OPEN Data law; 2. APIs - Discover APIs to incorporate on API.data.gov; show agency compliance with White House Memos  |
| 2  | 2  | Prototype is built and documented to make it extensible and replicable  | Individual can either stand-up their own copy or add their own scan  |
| 3  | 2  | Path to scale prototype (if successful) is in place  | Recommendations for 10x phase III funding; recommendations for future scans; lessons learned; long-term data storage recommendations|
